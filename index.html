                        The song is written from the point of view of a boy experiencing the aftermath of a breakup. The intro down to the first verse introduces us to the brokenhearted state of this boy.

                        “That day” could refer to the day of the break up. He says he is the same as that day in a way that he is still heartbroken, to the point that he can't even pick up the guitar anymore.<br><br>
        
                        As this verse plays, the music video shows Taesan, the main protagonist, joined with the other group members who represent his other personalities whom he made as a way to cope with his heartbreak. Different scenes in the music video continuously hint at this narrative.

                        The chorus talks about how he considers whether or not he should confess even if he would regret it. This regret could refer to the heartbreak he would go through from their break up.<br><br>
        
                        A small detail that could show just how much he truly loves this girl is in the way he says “I love you” in English, Japanese, and Korean. An added bonus is that the “I love you”s play at the 1:43 mark of the music video—this number, too, means “I love you” in slang.

                        Wanna tell ya<br>
                        I could fake the inspiration<br>
                        And write a lyric that's so cliché but<br>
                        In the end, it all comes back to you<br>
                        So sick of being sober<br>
                        Pretending this isn't a song about you<br>
                        I'll just keep on living like that, today, tomorrow, on and on<br>
                        But I'm so sick of it<br>

                        The second verse seems to be a denial of how he still loves the girl. All the lyrics he writes are still about her. He does this even when sober, hence, “So sick of being sober”. The verse ends with “But I'm so sick of it” as if to say, he doesn't want to keep pretending that their remaining feelings don't exist. The music video aligns with this as he is shown holding a book, entitled, “Say It”.

                        To be honest, music is nothing but<br>
                        One big emotional black hole<br>
                        Writing songs, playing guitar, it all feels meaningless<br>
                        Like I'm forcing a feeling, it all feels phony<br>
                        So I'm done<br>

                    <p class="after-quote" data-aos="fade-up">The bridge seems to be about how he feels about music now—inauthentic, forced, and meaningless—now that they are no longer together.</p>

                            But why is it that Taesan is only about to confess in the music video? The theory is that the whole video is just a reminiscence of the day he confesses to the girl, meaning it is set in the past.<br><br>
                    
                            Tripping on someone, approaching the wrong girl, getting hit on the head with a snowball, then fainting from the impact—it started with Taesan fumbling his confession. This could be his imagination of the situation in a way so that he wouldn't be able to confess—a way of coping with the heartbreak, like a wish for the confession to not have happened at all.

                        </video>
                        <p>
                            However, in the final scene, we return to the beginning sequence of the video, only this time, he goes for the right girl. The line “What’s it matter anyway” is heard before he starts running with a determined expression on his face, a representation that even if he knows he'll regret confessing because of the heartbreak he would later experience, he'll still do it anyway.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            His feelings are confessed through the yellow flower concealed and preserved by the coolness of the snowball, possibly a representation of the love he continued to have for the girl and how precious these feelings are to him still.
